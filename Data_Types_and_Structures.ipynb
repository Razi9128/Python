        "    \n",
        "    In Python, lists and tuples both store collections of elements, but they differ in key ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Mutability: Lists are mutable (modifiable), while tuples are immutable (unchangeable).\n",

        "    Performance: Tuples are faster and use less memory than lists.\n",

This meant that when you iterated over a dictionary, items could come out in any sequence—making it unpredictable for tasks where order mattered.\n",
